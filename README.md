# HTML SEO Refactor

## DESCRIPTION

Horiseon needed some refactoring to optimize their webpage based on their ability to reach their target audience as well as to make the webpage appropriate for accessibility. 

I learned basic HTML semantic tags, in order to organize the coding. As well as condensing the code lines to save the company money.
